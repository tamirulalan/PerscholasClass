 How do we assign a value to a variable? assignment operator(=)
How do we change the value of a variable? reassigning using assignment operator(=) if not const
How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable? let new one = the old one
Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
  declare== involves giving it a name and specifying its data type., assign is giving value, define is 
What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
        Pseudocode is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms. Pseudocode is a "text-based" detail (algorithmic) design tool.
What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
        it depends bit i would say 50% */

    /*    B. Strings
For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.
*/
/*Create a variable called firstVariable*/
//var firstVariable 
/*Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"*/
// var firstVariable ="Hello World"
// /*Change the value of this variable to some number*/
// var firstVariable=4
// /*Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable*/
// var secondVariable=4
// /*Change the value of secondVariableto any string.*/
// var secondVariable="changed"
// /*What is the value of firstVariable?*/
// console.log(firstVariable)
// //Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
// //ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean*/
// var yourName="Tamiru"
// console.log(`Hello, my name is ${yourName}`)
/* Booleans
Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so 
that all log statements print true in the console. 
Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things 
that don't make sense but happen to print true to the console */

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

// console.log(a < b);
// console.log(c > d);
// console.log('Name'=='Name');
// //   // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||

//console.log(a < (b && c)); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
//console.log(a*a ==d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
//console.log(48 == '48');

// D. The farm
// Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else
var animal ="cow"
// Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow

if (animal=='cow'){

// Change your code so that if the variable animalis anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."

//E. Driver's Ed
//Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic
/*Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", 
if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, 
a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."*/

        }
}
console.log(ageRange(10))

/*II. Loops
Remember: USE letwhen you initialize your for loops!
This is GOOD: for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
This is NO GOOD: for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)*/
// A. The basics
// Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive
        // for(let i=0; i<=10; i++){
        //        console.log(i) 
        // }

// Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
        // for(i=10; i<=400;i++){
        //         console.log(i)
        // }
// Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000
// for (i=12; i<400; i++){
//         i+=3
//         console.log(i)
// }

//B. Get even
//Print out the numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100
// for(i=1; i<=100; i++){
//         if(i%2==0){
//         console.log(`${i} is an even number`)
//        }
// }
//Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number"

/*Give me Five
For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a number. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five
Example Output:
I found a 5. High five!
I found a 10. High five!
Add to the code from above to print out "I found a number. 
Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three
*/
// for(i=0;i<99;i++){
//        if(i%5==0 && i%3==0){
//         console.log(`I found a ${i}. High five! Three is a crowd`)
//        }else if (i%3==0){
//         console.log(`I found a ${i}. Three is a crowd`)
//        }else if (i%5==0){
